# Game-Folder-Parser
This is simple parser for extracting keywords from folders with many files.

Usage

Open the parser_inventory.py in a notepad or notepad++.
Add your path to the folder you want to extract the keyword from.
Replace the keyword with whatever keyword you want to find in files.
Once done save the file.
Open a command prompt in the same directory as the scripts.
Execute the script with python parser_inventory.py
It will then spit the output into a .txt file.

Then open the parse_output.py file in a notepad.
Make sure you add for the input_file on line 3 the name of the text file that the parser_inventory.py created.
Ensure that the keywords you extracted from the folder also match the keywords in parse_output.py.
Then simply execute the script with python parse_output.py.
It will then create another .txt file with the output from the .txt file that the parser_inventory.py created.
